# A very simple IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

This checks for file creation, modification, deletion and port access

> **Warning**: I've only set this up to not scan certain files and folders on my computer. If not setup properly, this will scan your **ENTIRE** system, which can take up a lot of time and resources. Make sure to modify the code before running
